# Stack-Data-Structure
Personal practice to learn and improve understanding of a Stack Data Structure.

**Main Stack Operations:**  
***Push:*** Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.  
***Pop:*** Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed.   
***Top:*** Returns top element of stack.  
***isEmpty:*** Returns true if stack is empty, else false.  

**Steps to run program:**
1) Clone repository
2) Navigate to folder location
3) Compile with **javac Main.java** and **javac Stack.java**
4) Run with **java Main**

**Steps to run JavaDoc**
1) Clone repository
2) Navigate to folder location
3) Run javadoc with javadoc -d ./docs *.java
4) Navigate to created **./docs** folder
5) Double click file **index.html** to open webpage for documentation
