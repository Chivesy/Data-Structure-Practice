# Stack-Data-Structure
Overall this page and or project is for personal practice to review and improve data structure knowledge. Also to be used to showcase samples of my code and knowledge of various technology as I begin to look for entry level positions in the field. 

**Main Stack Operations:**  
***Push:*** adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.  
***Pop:*** removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed.   
***Top:*** returns top element of stack.  
***isEmpty:*** returns true if stack is empty, else false.  

**Main Linked List Operations:**  
***Traversal:*** traverse all the nodes one after another.  
***Insertion:*** insert a new item into the list.  
***Deletion:*** remove a item from the list.  
***Searching:*** search for an element or elements by value.  
***Sorting:*** arrange the list in a specific order.  
***Merging:*** merge two linked lists into one.  

**Steps to run program:**
1) Clone repository
2) Navigate to folder location
3) Compile with **javac Main.java** **Stack.java** **StackAsLinkedList.java** **SingleLinkedList.java** **DoubleLinkedList.java**
4) Run with **java Main**

**Steps to run javadoc:**
1) Clone repository
2) Navigate to folder location
3) Run javadoc with javadoc -d ./docs *.java
4) Navigate to created **./docs** folder
5) Double click file **index.html** to open webpage for documentation

TODO LIST:  
1) Arrays?  
2) Linked List  
3) Queues  
4) Trees  
6) Hash Tables  
7) Heaps  
8) Graphs  
9) Proper Test Cases  
10) Add pros / cons of each, plus speeds?
